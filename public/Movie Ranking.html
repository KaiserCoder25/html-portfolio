<H1>The Best Animes According To Vince Russel Antonio</H1>
<H2>My Top 3 Animes</H2>
<H3>1. Naruto</H3>
<P>This is an anime I started to love as a child. Though the series was incomplete from the television channel where it was introduced to me,I did find my way to get to watch the rest of the story when I grew up</P>
<H3>2. Freirin</H3>
<p>One of the best modern animes. It is unlike the others that simply follows the same format of a protagonist working there way up to be strong enough to beat the adversaries. The story already started in an aftermat of a war where the leader of the enemy is already dead. It's a cool showcase of "what if" you live a thousand years in an eye of an elf who basically grows old very slowly. How are sad things can heal thru time and how to live in the moment</p>
<H3>Bofuri</H3>
An anime in a virtual reality game setting. A simple yet adventurous little girl that want to play but doesn't want to get hurt. So what she did was put her stats all on defense.
